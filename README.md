# MUSIC_SIGNAL_ANALYSATION
This project aims at classification of signals using machine learning and signal processing.



Signal is analysed in Google's Colab in python and the model is built in MATLAB.
Why?
Because Python is better to analyse signals because of the availaibility of LibROSA library, while MATLAB is better for building Model
because of it's great UI and Deep learning, Machine learning ToolBox
I'd recommend collection and anaysation through the python code and model analysation through MATLAB.
